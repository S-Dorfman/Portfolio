# Portfolio Website

## Description

This portfolio website is built with ReactJS and Bootstrap. It was created with the goal of showcasing my portfolio in addition to providing additional information such as skills, availability and a convenient contact form. Much thought went into creating a positive user experience in order to navigate between pages, access the portfolio project links and contact me through linkedin, Github or the contact form. The API accesses a randomized Game of Thrones Quote in order to provide a fun detail while the user navigates through the website.
